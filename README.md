# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe with Minimax AI (Java)

This is a simple yet powerful **Tic Tac Toe game** built in **Java**, featuring an **unbeatable AI opponent** powered by the **Minimax algorithm**. The AI always plays optimally, so you can’t beat it — only force a tie with perfect play!

---

## 📌 Why I Built This

This project is part of my journey to practice **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in Java. Implementing the Minimax algorithm helped me understand recursion, backtracking, decision trees, and how AI can make optimal choices in simple games.

## 🧩 Features

✅ 2D array board representation  
✅ Human vs. AI gameplay in the console  
✅ Fully implemented Minimax algorithm  
✅ Detects win, loss, or tie  
✅ Clean, interactive CLI input/output

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Requirements

- Java JDK installed (`javac` and `java` available in your terminal)

---

### 2️⃣ Compile

```bash
javac TicTacToeMinimax2D.java
```
### 3️⃣ Run
```bash
 java TicTacToeMinimax2D
```
---

## 🎮 How to Play

You play as X, the AI plays as O.

Enter your move as row column (for example, 1 1 for top-left).

The AI will automatically calculate its best move and update the board.

The game continues until there’s a winner or a tie.
